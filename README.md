# Violence-Detection-By-YOLOv8
Developed a web-based violence detection system using YOLOv8 (converted to ONNX) to analyze uploaded videos, detect violent actions, and extract timestamped frames. Integrated Flask backend with Google Drive API for cloud storage and built a user-friendly dashboard for result display.
